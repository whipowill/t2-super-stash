# SuperStash

A Torchlight 2 mod to expand stash storage space.

I wanted a large shared shash where I could accumilate unique items from the game.

- Private stash is 10 pages of 80 slots (800 slots total).
- Shared stash is 100 pages of 80 slots (8000 slots total).
- Player inventory is unchanged.
- Pet inventory is unchanged.

Be sure to see how I [organize my stash](https://github.com/whipowill/t2-super-stash/blob/master/STASH.md).

## Notes

- This is a fork of [Big Bag](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=136585458) mod.
- The game cannot handle a stash size that is too large, so I settled on 100 pages.
