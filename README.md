# SuperStash

A Torchlight 2 mod to expand stash storage space.

I wanted a large shared shash where I could accumilate unique items from the game.

- Private stash is 10 pages of 80 slots (800 slots total).
- Shared stash is 100 pages of 80 slots (8000 slots total).
- Player inventory is unchanged.
- Pet inventory is unchanged.

## Recommendations

Here is how I organize my stash:

- Pages 1-10 - Stuff To Sort Later
- Pages 11-20 - Sockets
- Pages 21-30 - Melee Weapons
- Pages 31-40 - Magic Weapons
- Pages 41-50 - Guns
- Pages 51-60 - Berserker Armor
- Pages 61-70 - Embermage Armor
- Pages 71-80 - Engineer Armor
- Pages 81-90 - Outlander Armor
- Pages 91-100 - Misc Armor

## Notes

- This is a fork of [Big Bag](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=136585458) mod.
- The game cannot handle a stash size that is too large, so I settled on 100 pages.
